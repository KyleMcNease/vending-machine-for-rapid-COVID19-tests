Conceived in 2020 and open-sourced for community iteration, this system attempts to addresses, however inadequate, the need for frictionless access to tests while generating anonymized epidemiological data to identify potential transmission hotspots. Each machine could function as a node in a mesh network, enabling inter-machine communication for inventory alerts and data aggregation to a central cloud platform. The design prioritizes speed of implementation, low cost, and open-source compatibility, using commercially available components to facilitate rapid prototyping by makers and deployment in suitable environments.</p> <p>System Design Overview: The hardware is built around a Raspberry Pi 4 as the core microcontroller for its ease of use, GPIO expandability, and community support. Dispensing uses a belt conveyor mechanism to handle fragile test kits (estimate: 6x3x1 inches per kit, or boxed 9x6.5x3.25 inches for 25 kits), with capacity for 200-300 kits across multiple slots. Power is solar-assisted (10W panel with battery backup) for outdoor sustainability, enclosed in a weatherproof steel cabinet. User interaction is intended to be frictionless: scan a QR code via a mobile app to select quantity, then dispense via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or SMS. Sensors monitor inventory, temperature (to maintain 2-30\u00b0C for test efficacy), and security. Networking includes WiFi/4G for cloud uplink, LoRa-based mesh for inter-machine resilience, and anonymous data transmission.</p> <p>Key Technical Features: - Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4, stepper motors for dispensing, ultrasonic sensors for inventory, DHT22 for environmental monitoring, BLE module (ESP32 add-on), cellular modem for SMS. - Software: Firmware in Python (using libraries like RPi.GPIO, bleak for BLE), cross-platform Flutter app for QR/BLE/SMS, OpenRemote cloud for fleet management and analytics. - Data and Analytics: Anonymized timestamps and geolocation data stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB), with anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., using something like Pandas/Scikit-learn) to flag usage spikes. Privacy adheres to HIPAA-like anonymization, with no personal identifiers collected. - Deployment: Outdoor-focused, ADA-compliant, with site selection based on demographics and accessibility. Regulatory framing as a public health tool, not a diagnostic device. It is not intended to replace FDA authorized and/or approved diagnostic testing or CLIA certified and authorized testing. This is solely intended as a public health tool and not a registered diagnostic. </p> <p>Feasibility and Validation: Components may be sourced from US vendors like Adafruit, Digi-Key, and Amazon for low-cost accessibility (&lt;$500/unit prototype). Design draws from existing open-source projects (e.g., Intel's Intelligent Vending Machine on GitHub, Instructables Arduino Vending) adapted for medical kits. Stress testing includes 1000 dispense cycles, environmental exposure (-10\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C), and FCC/UL compliance checks. Scalability from pilot (1-10 machines) to citywide (100+) may be achievable via mesh networking and cloud auto-scaling.</p> <p>Economic and Sustainability: With uncertainty related to viral transmission, second and third order effects impacting source materials, supplies and logistics, it is impossible to state with anything like certainty what the exact cost and ROI might be. However, we can share an estimate that will, of course, change as circumstances change. It may be possible to build the prototype BOM ~$450, with scaling to &lt;$300/unit at volume. Sustainability via solar power could reduce operational costs. There may also be available funding through grants or partnerships that could defray the cost. Potential ROI via public health benefits: anonymity may reduce stigma and therefore increase willingness to test. Due to the rapid antigen tests being free and accessible to the end-user, this may also increase willingness, frequency, and intensity of use. Due to increased testing volume, even if rapid tests were found not to be equivalent to \"Gold Standard\" PCRs (see comment below), it is still conceivable that a person testing more regularly with rapid tests could derive benefit by detecting early signals of infection. As a public health tool, earlier detection of possible infection could help people seek appropriate testing and care via licensed doctors. Earlier signal detection and confirmation via FDA &amp; CLIA authorized and/or approved testing could help reduce transmission by interrupting chains of transmission. This would prove especially helpful if testing is carried out regularly, even among \"asymptomatic\" individuals. Keep in mind that current \"Gold Standard\" PCR testing takes some time to return results. It is therefore conceivable that if a person were to wait until symptomatic to seek out PCR testing, the patient may be required to wait for results before receiving treatment. </p> <p>While this document contains certain technical specifications and speculations, it is no way intended to serve as, suggest, imply, replace in whole or in part, any medical guidance, advice, or public health messaging.

This ensures minimal drop impact (e.g., shelves move in a controlled oval path, reducing acceleration on kits). Key mechanical details: - Belt Structure: Composed of identical, molded polypropylene elements (H-shaped with shelves). Each element has dowel pins and tubular rollers for smooth, bearing-like motion. Shelves are spaced 4-6 inches apart to hold 1-5 kits per slot (capacity: 200-300 kits total across 3-5 belts). - Path: Vertically elongated oval track (raceway ~1 inch wide) with inner/outer walls to guide rollers. Drive via sprocket wheel (U-shaped cutouts engage ribs on belt elements) rotated step-by-step (e.g., 1/4 turn per dispense). - Adaptation for Fragility: Add protective webs/plates to prevent kits from shifting; use yieldable resin for shock absorption.
